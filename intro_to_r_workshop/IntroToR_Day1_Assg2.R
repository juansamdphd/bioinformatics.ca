## set working directory

## read in Assignment_data2.txt data

## inspect your data

## recode factors in your data:
## malignant = 0,1 c("Benign","Malignant")
## sex = 0,1 c("Male", "Female")
## city = 0,1,2,3,4 c("Toronto","Addis Ababa","Paris","Sao Pauo","Manila")

## This data simulates data from a community skin cancer biopsy program. 
## Each city collected data on the people it successfully screened in the first month of 
## Operations and whether those individuals' biopsies came back as 
## Benign or Malignant

## First we'd like to know the malignancy rates overall
  ## use the table() function to find this

## Do malignancy rates differ signficantly by sex? 

## Do malignancy rates differ significantly by city? 

## Melt your <malignancy x city> table using reshape 
## and use ggplot to create barplots of malignancy rates by city. 
## Don't forget to make your ggplot look pretty!
